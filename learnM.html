        A network engineer is a technology professional who has the necessary skills to plan, implement and oversee the computer networks that support in-house voice, data, video and wireless network services. 
        
        
       <h2> What does a network engineer do?</h2>>
Network engineers focus on delivering high-availability network infrastructure to sustain the users' online 
and on-site information technology activities. Network engineers often overlap with other roles, 
such as computer network architects or security systems engineers, and work internally within an organization 
or as outside consultants.<br> <br>

Network engineers design and implement network configurations, 
troubleshoot performance issues, carry out network monitoring and 
configure security systems such as firewalls. They often report to a CIO, chief information security officer and 
other line-of-business leaders to discuss and decide upon overall business goals, policies and network status updates. 
In many situations, network engineers work closely with project managers and other engineers, manage capacity and carry out remote or on-site support.
