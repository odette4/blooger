        Software engineers, often called software developers, plan and create programs.
         They determine user needs, design software and then test it to ensure quality.
          They give instructions to programmers who write the software code. Engineers who specialize in the operating systems needed by computers are called systems software developers. Those who focus on applications, such as games, video editors, word processors and databases, are called applications software developers. They require a minimum bachelorâ€™s degree in software engineering, computer science or a related field. Though they do not usually write code,
         they also need strong programming skills to communicate properly with programmers. </p>
